## Introduction

### Objective

The objective for this project is as follows:
> To create a service-orientated architecture for your application, this application must be composed of at least 4 services that work together.

The other constraint in this project is the technologies that need to be used.
The project needs to utilise the technologies discussed during the training modules:
* Kanban Board: Asana or an equivalent Kanban Board
* Version Control: Git - using the feature-branch model
* CI Server: Jenkins
* Configuration Management: Ansible
* Cloud server: GCP virtual machines
* Containerisation: Docker
* Orchestration Tool: Docker Swarm
* Reverse Proxy: NGINX
* Database Layer: MySQL

### Proposal

At the start of the project, I realised that to meet all the requirements and to ensure the MVP was produced in the time frame provided, I focused on the infrastructure and implementation of my CI/CD pipeline. Therefore the application itself is less important with only the essential features developed.

#### Kendama Ordering
* Service-1 (front-end): Displays the results of the following 3 services for the user to see, as well as a brief history of past results.
* Service-2: Returns a random Kendama from a predefined list.
* Service-3: Returns a random accessory from a predefined list.
* Service-4: Returns the total price from both Kendama and accessory and add Â£3.50 for shipping.

## Architecture

### Risk Assessment

My detailed risk assessment can be seen below, outlining the minor and major risks that have potential to impact the success of this project. Creating a risk assessment is important in any project as it helps make the project more robust and provides methods of mitigating the impact of any such risk that does occur.

### Trello Board

For project tracking i decided to use [Trello](https://trello.com) over other similar services as Trello is super lightweight and has a visusal representation that is easy to understand and follow.
